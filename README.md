# Nexus NFT Collection DApp

This project is a full-stack decentralized application (dApp) for minting and viewing NFTs on the [Nexus](https://nexus.xyz) blockchain testnet. It consists of two main parts:

---

## Project Structure & Components

### 1. NFT Logic (Smart Contract)
- **Location:** `contracts/`, `scripts/`, `hardhat.config.ts`
- **Description:**
  - The core NFT logic is implemented in the Solidity smart contract `SimpleNFT.sol`.
  - This contract is an ERC-721 NFT with owner enumeration and metadata management.
  - Deployment and management scripts are provided using Hardhat.
  - The contract is responsible for minting, tracking ownership, and managing NFT metadata.

### 2. Frontend (Next.js App)
- **Location:** `frontend/`
- **Description:**
  - The frontend is a React app built with Next.js.
  - It allows users to mint NFTs and view NFTs owned by any address.
  - Uses ethers.js to interact with the deployed smart contract on the blockchain.
  - Requires the contract's ABI and address to communicate with the NFT logic.

---

## What is the ABI?

**ABI** stands for **Application Binary Interface**. It is a JSON file generated when you compile your smart contract. The ABI defines how the frontend (or any client) can interact with the contract: what functions are available, what parameters they take, and what data they return. 

- In this project, the ABI for `SimpleNFT.sol` is generated by Hardhat and copied to `frontend/abi/SimpleNFT.json`.
- The frontend imports this ABI to know how to call contract functions (like minting or querying NFTs).
- Keeping the ABI in sync with the deployed contract is essential for the frontend to work correctly.

> **Important:** Whenever you make edits to the Solidity contract (`.sol` files), you must:
> 1. Recompile the contract with `npx hardhat compile`.
> 2. Copy the updated ABI to the frontend with `node copy-abi.js`.
> 3. (If you redeploy) Update the contract address in `frontend/.env.local`.

---

## Features
- **Mint NFTs**: Anyone can mint an NFT to their own or another address.
- **View NFTs**: Enter any wallet address to see all NFTs owned by that address.
- **No images/metadata**: This demo does not serve images or metadata for NFTs.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexus-xyz/example-nft-minter
pnpm install # or npm install, make sure you install in root as well as frontend directories
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root with:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_for_deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000 # or your deployed frontend URL
```

In `frontend/`, create a `.env.local` file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
```

---

### 3. Compile & Deploy the Smart Contract

```bash
npx hardhat compile
node scripts/deploy.js
```
- The deployment script will print the contract address. Copy this address for the frontend config.

---

### 4. Copy the ABI for Frontend Use

After deploying, run:

```bash
node copy-abi.js
```
This copies the contract ABI to `frontend/abi/SimpleNFT.json` for the frontend to use.

---

### 5. Configure the Frontend

In `frontend/.env.local`, set:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
```

---

### 6. Run the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install # or npm install
pnpm dev # or npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the app.
